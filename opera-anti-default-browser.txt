If you have come across the agressive and unsolicited behavior by Opera to make itself default browser without your permission in Linux, I have the solution. It's iron-clad and developer proof solution.

If your default browser is another and Opera is just secondary for websites testing, first set your preferred browser in your desktop settings. In Cinnamon, XFCE, Gnome it should be "Preferred programs"
or something like that.
After that open ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache in any text editor (gedit, pluma, etc), press CTRL+H and in the first field type (without the quotes) "opera.desktop;", leave the second field empty and press "Replace all".
Thirdly, open the desktop file with the same name ("opera.desktop" - by default it's in /usr/share/applications, unless you have manually moved it to ~/.local/share/applications) with a text editor
(this will require sudo, if the desktop file is in /usr/share/applications) and remove the entire line that starts with "MimeType=". Save the changes and exit the text editor.
Finally, open terminal and type:

sudo chattr +i /usr/share/applications/opera.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/mimetype.cache

In some rare cases you may have to run:

update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications

But in most cases it's better to reboot the system.
After you do that, Opera will no longer be able to make itself default browser, no matter what the devs do bc they don't know your sudo password and thus they won't be able to revert your changes.

P.S. Something similar (read-only) could work in Windows, but considering that OS is even more aggressive when it comes to limiting users rights, I highly doubt it would work.
