This repository will include text files with solutions against aggressive software (like Opera browser) doing whatever it wants in Linux without the user's permission.
My distro is normally Arch but I had to rename it to "Resist OS" because of the many changes I made to it over the past 7 years. The main reason I chose this particular name is because much of the software I use and the way I use it is a form of resistance against developers who try to dictate how I'll use that software on my own PC. This is Linux, FFS, not... another famous and aggressive OS.
So, you could call this repository a "Resist OS knowledge base". :)
